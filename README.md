# Project Overview

An exoplanet is any planet which orbits around any start except our Sun. Exoplanets are hard to see through telescopes, so we can track them through light collection. By looking at a star and measuring it's light output, we can hopefully get an idea if that star contains a planet or not. The purpose of this project is to have a reliable way of measuring and predicting if a start would have a planet orbiting based off it's light output. Kepler is a spacecraft launched by NASA in 2009. This spacecraft measures the light output of stars to see if a planet is in transit in front, blocking some light. By not only tracking the transits for existance of a planet, we can also measure the time between transits getting an idea of the distance from the sun. Shorter transit times equal closer to the star.
